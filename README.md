<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This was the response code as was requested by <a href="http://twitter.com/robertbanh" target="_blank">@robertbanh</a> in order to import his scripts on <a href="http://snipt.net" target="_blank">Snipt.net</a> to <a href="http://codesnipp.it" target="_blank">CodeSnipp.it</a> and has since grown to a actual importing script</p>

<h1>Some info :)</h1>
<p>It is very basic in its functionality, but quite powerful :) Just change the username and password fields where needed, and you can start importing :) I coded this with console access in mind, but you can just adapt it to support a browser accessing it :)</p>

<h1>Comments? Changes?</h1>
<p>Please note that this is the initial version, and will be extend upon later on</p>
