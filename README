This was the response code as was requested by @robertbanh in order to import his scripts on http://snipt.net to CodeSnipp.it and has since grown to a actual importing script
 
It is very basic in its functionality, but quite powerful :)
Just change the username and password fields where needed, and you can start importing :)
I coded this with console access in mind, but you can just adapt it to support a browser accessing it :)

Please note that this is the initial version, and will be extend upon later on
